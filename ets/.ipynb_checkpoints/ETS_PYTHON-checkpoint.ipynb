    "Before going through this article, I highly recommend reading A Complete Tutorial on Time Series Modeling in R, which is like a prequel to this article. It focuses on fundamental concepts and is based on R and I will focus on using these concepts in solving a problem end-to-end along with codes in Python. Many resources exist for TS in R but very few are there for Python so I’ll be using Python in this article.\n",

    "As the name suggests, TS is a collection of data points collected at constant time intervals. These are analyzed to determine the long term trend so as to forecast the future or perform some other form of analysis. But what makes a TS different from say a regular regression problem? There are 2 things:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is time dependent. So the basic assumption of a linear regression model that the observations are independent doesn’t hold in this case.\n",
    "Along with an increasing or decreasing trend, most TS have some form of seasonality trends, i.e. variations specific to a particular time frame. For example, if you see the sales of a woolen jacket over time, you will invariably find higher sales in winter seasons.\n",
    "Because of the inherent properties of a TS, there are various steps involved in analyzing it. These are discussed in detail below. Lets start by loading a TS object in Python. We’ll be using the popular AirPassengers data set which can be downloaded here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the aim of this article is to familiarize you with the various techniques used for TS in general. The example considered here is just for illustration and I will focus on coverage a breadth of topics and not making a very accurate forecast."
